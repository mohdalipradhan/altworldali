In adherence to project guidelines, I've meticulously ensured compliance throughout the development process. Leveraging Next.js with TypeScript, I've integrated Chakra UI for seamless template design. Additionally, I've implemented local storage functionality to facilitate the shortlisting of candidates upon selection, while also ensuring dynamic elements for an engaging user experience.

Key Components:

Utilization of a mock API containing candidate details such as percentage, name, email, experience, etc.
Integration of Chakra UI for an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive design.
Implementation of local storage to enable the shortlisting process, with a validation feature ensuring that only candidates with a total score above 50 percent are shortlisted.
Overall, this approach not only meets project requirements but also enhances user interaction and functionality


Deployment is done in vercel as told
